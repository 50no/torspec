                               The Tor Project

Note: This document aims to specify terms, notations or phrases related
to Tor and The Tor Project.

This glossary is not a design document; it is only a reference.

0. Preliminaries

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.

0.1 Commonly used Tor configuration terms

   ORPort  - Onion Router Port
   DirPort - Directory Port

0.2 Tor network components

   Relay, aka OR (onion router)  -
     Exit relay
     Non-exit relay
     Guard relay
   Client, aka OP (onion proxy)

   Bridge  -

   Circuit: An established path through the network, where cryptographic keys
   are negotiated using the ntor protocol with each hop. Circuits can differ
   in length depending on their purpose. See also Leaky Pipe Topology.

    Origin Circuit -

    Exit Circuit: A circuit which connects clients to destinations
    outside the Tor network. For example, if a client wanted to visit
    duckduckgo.com, this connection would require an exit circuit.

    Internal Circuit: A circuit whose traffic never leaves the Tor
    network. For example, a client could connect to a hidden service via
    an internal circuit.

   Stream
   Edge connection:

   TLS connection:

   Link handshake
   Circuit handshake

   Leaky Pipe Topology: The ability for packets to be addressed to any hop
   in the path of a circuit. The destination hop is determined by using the
   recognized field of relay cells.
